    <h3> Description</h3>
    <p>This strawberry rhubarb pie recipe is as fool-proof as can be and is really delicious. The crust is my grandmother's recipe. It's made with vegetable oil and milk blended into flour. It rolls out beautifully and is the perfect pastry to hold this delicious pie's rhubarb and strawberry filling.    </p>
