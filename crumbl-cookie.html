            <p>1 1/2 cups confectioners sugar</p>
            <p>1/4 teaspoon lemon zest</p>

    <h3> Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with silicone baking mats.</li>
            <li>Whisk together flour, 1/4 cup graham cracker crumbs, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg in a medium bowl until combined.</li>
            <li>Beat butter, cream cheese, white sugar, brown sugar, egg, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until lightened and fairly smooth, 4 to 5 minutes. There will still be some small chunks of cream cheese in the mixture, and that is okay. Beat in lemon zest and juice. Pour in half the flour mixture and mix until just combined. Add in remaining flour mixture and mix until just combined. Fold in blueberries with a spatula.</li>
            <li>In a shallow bowl or pie plate, stir together 1/2 cup graham cracker crumbs and 3 tablespoons white sugar. Drop an approximately 2 tablespoon-sized piece of cookie dough into graham cracker mixture, and coat with crumbs. Carefully roll dough into a ball, and roll again in crumbs to coat. Place dough balls at least 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets. Repeat with remaining dough.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cookies begin to turn golden, and no longer look wet on top, 15 to 17 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>To make icing, whisk together powdered sugar, 2 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon lemon zest, and salt until combined. Whisk in heavy cream. Glaze each cookie with a scant tablespoon of icing, then add a sprinkle of graham cracker crumbs plus 3 blueberries on top, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
